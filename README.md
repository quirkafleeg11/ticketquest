# TicketQuest
For Helpdesks where a ticketing system is used.
A simple levelling/xp system a la RPGs to make closing tickets feel more rewarding. When you close a ticket, select the relevent priority
level to add some xp, and press level up at over 50 xp (not at exactly 50).
PIN THE TAB AND JUST FLICK BACK TO IT WHEN YOU WANT TO ADD XP.
